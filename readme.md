## installation


This folder should live inside a `src` folder inside a `catkin_ws` workspace.
The folder strucutre should look something like this:

```shell
~/catkin_ws/src/vroom_localization/
```

To get there navigate to the `src` folder and clone the repository.

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/FAR-Lab/vroom_localization.git
```

After that you need to install all depeendencies, which is sadly not yet automated.
For now I have to leave you with telling you to look into the package.xml. all required packages are there.

Best wishes

Let me know if that works or not.
